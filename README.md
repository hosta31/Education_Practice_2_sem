This is a C++ program for educational practice.
It takes English text and returns an array of words from the text sorted by their length in descending order in result.txt.
It also returns some statistics, including word count, sort time and the number of words of each size in analysis.txt.
The path to the input text is entered from the keyboard and 2 output files will be written to the same folder.
